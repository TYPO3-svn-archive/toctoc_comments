Translating the extension
=========================

Translation of the extension happens through TYPO3 translation server. If you do not know what
translation server is, read about it `here <http://wiki.typo3.org/index.php/Translations>`__. 

You'll find more info about available translations on page `Language packs and translation team
<https://www.toctoc.ch/en/home/toctoc-comments/toctoc-comments-demo/toctoc-comments-ll/>`__

Troubles with the TYPO3 translation server?
-------------------------------------------

If you translate the extension and don't know how to use the TYPO3 translation server., then please
contact us over our website `www.toctoc.ch <http://www.toctoc.ch/>`__.

Once we contact you can send the translated xml files by e-mail (zip-format) - we will upload the
translations then on the Server.
