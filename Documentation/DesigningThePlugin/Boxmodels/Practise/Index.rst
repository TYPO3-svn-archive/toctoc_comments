Practise
^^^^^^^^

You can use FireBug or your other browsers Debugfeature to make changes in the CSS and then document
the changes in the boxmodel-file. After you save the boxmodel file and you reload the page, the
changes are made. This is very handy to develop a new version of the plugins CSS.

The work with the boxmodel additionally allows to give speaking names to (groups of) CSS selectors
and associated properties. It's easy to track the ideas behind changes made to the CSS.
