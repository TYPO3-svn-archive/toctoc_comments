TypoScript and themes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Themes are setup up in TS at the base of a web page, so you can have different themes on different
pages. 

You can specify themes per User or User group, using User TS or Conditions in general TS setup.
Scheduled themes are also possible to realize with conditions in TS.
