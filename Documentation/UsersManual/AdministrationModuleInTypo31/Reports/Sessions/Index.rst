In the Sessionreport the current sessions made with **toctoc_comments**  are shown. Session-files
reside in pi1/temp-Folder and they contain information about the user, IP, pages visited and cookies
found on the client.

In the session report you can delete individual sessions and you can black list
IPs.
You can filter the sessions and see only long or short sessions.
