Email confirmation opt-in (COI)
-------------------------------

.. index::
	single: Setup; Email confirmation opt-in

If a comment is set to **hidden**  it is because the Email confirmation opt-in is active
(confirmedOptIn=1) and the user did not yet confirm his email.

When confirmedOptIn is set to 1 and a user sends a comment he has to confirm his email before the
comment will appear in the frontend. 
This confirmation is necessary once **per
email and used IP-address** .
