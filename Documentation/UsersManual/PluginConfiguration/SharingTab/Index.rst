**Use Sharing** enables the sharing function in the plugin

**use only sharing** enables the plugin in exclusive sharing mode, this option is stronger than "ratings only"

**Use sharing design** allows to specify how the sharing component will look like.

**don't use sharing** disables the Sharing function for a given platform individually

**Text to show after total of users who shared the page**: with this you can 
display another text rather than "10 shares", for example "10 users shared toctoc_comments"

**page URL to share**: with this you can fix the URL of the page that will be shared. 

This is useful for pages that are sometimes called with GET-Parameters, or http/https. 
You can fix the URL to the desired URL and always display correct sharing counts.

**Text to show in social networks sharing window** : 
When you share on Twitter, you can add this text automatically as the text for the sharing
