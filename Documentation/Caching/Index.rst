Caching
=======

Up to version 3.5.0 **toctoc_comments**  had no options for cache handling.

With Version 3.6.0 the behavior how cache is handled can be changed. By default, the old caching
behavior remains active, but it is recommended to have a look at the caching possibilities and
considerations below, if you run **toctoc_comments**  

- only for ratings or sharings
- if you clone plugins on different pages
- if you comment or rate on the same records on different pages
